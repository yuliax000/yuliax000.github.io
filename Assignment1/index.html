                What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
                with the experience?
                <p>
                  The first thing I notice was its visual style. The floating 3D
                  elements feel novel when my cursor moves over them. As the
                  cursor moves around, these elements rotate slightly, enhancing
                  the sense of space visually. This attracts me to stay in the
                  website and makes me more willing to interact with it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each
                of your discrete actions.

                  <ul>
                    <li>Move my cursor around</li>
                    <li>Click on the “studio” 3D elements and white space</li>
                    <li>
                      Drag the cursor from left to right, then from right to
                      left
                    </li>
                    <li>Interact with the small screen in the 3D scene</li>
                    <li>
                      Move the cursor to the “studio” button at the bottom-right
                      corner
                    </li>
                    <li>Click the “studio” button</li>
                    <li>Click the cross button to close the studio webpage</li>
                    <li>Click the home button at the bottom-right corner</li>
                  </ul>
                </section1>
              </li>
              <li>
                What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
                with?
                <p>
                  Interacting with the 3D visual elements and engaging with the
                  clickable objects.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
                with the experience?
                <p>
                  Dragging and moving the cursor to observe how the 3D models
                  are animated.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
                interactive experience?
                <p>
                  it is quite engaging, effectively capturing my attention
                  through smooth animations and harmonious colors.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
                goal?
                <p>
                  Users can interact with the elements simply by moving the
                  cursor. The animations clearly indicate which elements are
                  clickable, while changing the cursor into a circle with text
                  cleverly communicates the theme of each section.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is your impression of how the experience should be
                interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different
                times)
                <p>
                  I spent a considerable amount of time interacting with the 3D
                  scenes. They were playful enough that I revisited each scene
                  about three times.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
                interacted with over time?
                <p>
                  By incorporating abundant interactive animations and click
                  feedback, the text menu in the lower-right corner pops up and
                  uses a vivid green color to capture the user’s attention.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
                experience reference?
                <p>
                  The scene contains many interesting mini-games, with
                  animations designed to hold users’ attention for a longer
                  period. By controlling the duration of these animations, it’s
                  possible to guide how long users stay on each page.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
                should act when engaging with your research experience?
                <p>
                  Change the cursor’s shape and add text. Small looping
                  animations around the lower-right button hint to users that it
                  is clickable.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
                should feel when engaging with your research experience?
                <p>
                  Soft colors and slower page transitions create a sense of
                  relaxation and comfort. Creative games add an element of fun
                  and surprise to the webpage, making the experience feel
                  joyful.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
                what makes that part frustrating?
                <p>
                  The animation when switching from the home page to other pages
                  is too slow, making the feedback less immediate and
                  inconsistent with the other quick, responsive feedback found
                  throughout the website.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
                what makes that part satisfying?
                <p>
                  The scene changes when moving the mouse make the mouse
                  movement feel clear and prevent users from getting lost in
                  visual effects. Additionally, allowing the mouse to control
                  the scene’s viewing angle gives users a greater sense of
                  control.
                </p>
