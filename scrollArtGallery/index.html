  <!-- I have studied on this tutorial as reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8y9u0hc3U0 -->
  <!-- at first, I tried to apply the style in that tutorial
and I change some layout setting to make it fit my layout.
unfortunately, the way the tutorial shows isn't the movement I want.
It refresh each time so the scroll(especially with size change) looks not smooth and natural at all.
everytime I scroll, all the cards gather together and then align to the layout.
Therefore I'm not using that method, but it's worthwhile to learn such an implement. -->
  <body>
    <div id="title">My Art Gallery</div>
    <div id="instruction">scroll to explore</div>

    <!-- prepare 3 groups pictures to make it looks like infinite scroll visually -->
    <div class="imgs">
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/1.jpg" alt="img1" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/2.jpg" alt="img2" />
      <img id="img3" src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/3.png" alt="img3" />
      <img id="img4" src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/4.png" alt="img4" />
      <img id="img5" src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/5.png" alt="img5" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/6.jpg" alt="img6" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/7.jpg" alt="img7" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/8.jpg" alt="img8" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/9.jpg" alt="img9" />
      <img src="/scrollArtGallery/assets/10.jpg" alt="img10" />

      <!--------- I firstly tried to copy 3 groups of pictures to fake the infinite scroll effect
       the core is when scrolling to the bonding of final group, jump to first groups' same position
       however the jumping process is slow and obvious, it doesn't look like infinite scroll. 
       I decide to use Js to clone the group (I recogonize that its the same effect as I copy them manually).
       At this stage it looks quite like infinite scroll, except the annoying jumping animation.
       I'm going to save this demo but explore the other way to imply infinite scroll-------->
