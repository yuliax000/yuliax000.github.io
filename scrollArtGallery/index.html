  <!-- I have studied on this tutorial as reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8y9u0hc3U0 -->
  <!-- at first, I tried to apply the style in that tutorial
and I change some layout setting to make it fit my layout.
unfortunately, the way the tutorial shows isn't the movement I want.
It refresh each time so the scroll(especially with size change) looks not smooth and natural at all.
everytime I scroll, all the cards gather together and then align to the layout.
Therefore I'm not using that method, but it's worthwhile to learn such an implement. -->
  <!-- I've also tried the method mentioned in this tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UXJb4rjeDg. 
 haven't found the bug, but it doesn't work(probably because of innerwidth of my clone group is too big).
  but I use some code as inspiration-->

    <!-- The main objective of this website is to showcase the artist’s works in a pure and focused way. 
I wanted the site to serve as a clean visual space where the artworks themselves take center stage. 
Throughout the entire site, I included only two lines of text — the title and a short instruction — 
to avoid distracting users from the visual content. 

I used different font sizes and colors to distinguish the two lines, 
clarifying their separate communicative functions. 
Both are vertically aligned so that when users first enter the page, 
their attention naturally goes to the clearest image at the center, 
followed by the equally visible text. 

My goal was to preserve simplicity and visual order, 
so I intentionally avoided adding unnecessary features or information to this interface. 
Even in future development, I plan to keep navigation minimal 
and limit the number of entry points to other pages to prevent visual clutter or distraction.-->
